# owasp-juiceshop-writeups
These are my personal and intentionally a bit dumb writeups in breaking owasp juice shop, an intentionally insecure web application.

This is how I track my progress in learning web application penetration testing 

# structure
I categorized this not by the difficulty, but by the vulnerability to showcase the skills of breaking OWASP top 10 or common security risks

# how I write the challenge
- vulnerability (challenge name)
- steps to reproduce
- explanation to why it happened or how to fix
